Basic GPU applications, matrix multiplication and some client-server collision detection work. The client and the server are asyncronous, there is still a lot of work to be done, the collision detection only works for bounding boxes at the moment, rough bounding boxes. Some of the static objects coordinates are not calculated right so the server is not really aware they are in the place.
